# Traffic-AI
BACKGROUND:

As part of the ongoing research into autonomous vehicles, a significant challenge involves the development of computer vision technologies that enable these vehicles to interpret their surroundings based on digital images. A crucial aspect of this involves the ability to detect and differentiate between various road signs, such as stop signs, speed limit signs, and yield signs.

In this AI project, I utilize TensorFlow to construct a neural network capable of classifying road signs based on digital images. To accomplish this, I leverage a labeled dataset consisting of images that have already been categorized according to the specific road sign represented within each image. While various datasets exist for this purpose, I opt to use the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which encompasses thousands of images depicting 43 different types of road signs.

In addition to utilizing TensorFlow for neural network construction, I also employ opencv-python for image processing and scikit-learn for various machine learning-related functions. With opencv-python, I am able to preprocess the digital images of road signs to enhance their quality and ensure that they are well-suited for neural network classification. Similarly, scikit-learn offers a broad range of machine learning tools and algorithms that are instrumental in developing accurate and effective models for road sign recognition. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive suite of capabilities that enable me to develop a robust and reliable system for identifying and interpreting various types of road signs.

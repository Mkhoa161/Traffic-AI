# Traffic-AI
In this AI project, I harnessed TensorFlow to create a neural network for road sign classification using labeled digital images. Specifically, I chose the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which includes thousands of images depicting 43 distinct road signs. Alongside TensorFlow, I employed opencv-python to preprocess images for improved quality and used scikit-learn for various machine learning functions, resulting in a robust system for accurate road sign identification.
